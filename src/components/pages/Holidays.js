      <h4>What are Tailor-made Holidays?</h4>
        <p>A tailor-made holiday with Bliss Flights is all about creating your trip, your way. So, while we know our hand-picked itineraries are amazing, we also know that not all travelers are the same. That’s why we offer the tailor-made approach where we take the time to speak to you about what you’re looking for, consider your needs and budget, and custom-build a holiday to match.  <br/>
And with thousands of Bliss Flights Travel Consultants across the globe, we have plenty of experience in crafting these bespoke trips, while offering help and travel advice along the way.
</p>
            <h4>But why should I tailor make my holiday?
</h4>
        <p>Tailor making a trip gives you the choice and flexibility to stay in the destination (or destinations!) you want, for the money you have available. With a tailor-made holiday, you will receive the best advice and your expert travel consultant will remove the time-consuming and stressful process of putting together your next holiday. Simply put: you’re in control. Not to mention you’ll have a holiday that no one else has – how’s that for a boast-worthy experience?
</p>
            <h4>Is there a limit to the duration of my tailor-made holiday?
</h4>
        <p>Absolutely not – stay for as little or as long as you like. And whether you want to cram loads of activities into a week or spread them out over three, we’ll build an itinerary that works for you.
</p>
            <h4>Can I add a different destination to my tailor-made holiday?
</h4>
        <p>Yes. Just let us know where else you’d like to go and how long for. We have some great stopover airfares too, perfect if you want to break up a long trip. For example, you can easily spend three nights in Dubai en route to Australia.

</h4>
