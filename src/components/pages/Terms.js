    <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
    <h4>• IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4>
    <h4>1.Contract</h4>
    <p1>
    Your contract is with Bliss Flights Ltd. These conditions form part of that contract for 
    all arrangements you book with us.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    </p1>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h4>2.Payments</h4>
    <p1>
    The payment required at the time of booking will depend on the arrangements you choose. 
    Full payment is usually required immediately.
     Although a provisional reservation for a scheduled flight may be made on payment of a deposit,
      normally 35% of the total cost of these arrangements or a minimum of £100, (whichever is the greater), 
      and must be paid as a deposit at the time of booking. However, on payment of deposit only, a confirmed 
      booking cannot be made, nor can the price be guaranteed, until full payment for the ticket has been 
      received and the ticket issued.
    <br/>
    Deposit payments are 100% non-refundable.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Note: airlines are at liberty to change prices, or cancel the booking, at any time without prior
     notification. If either of these actions should happen, additional charges may occur.
If full payment is not made at the time of booking, we must receive the balance no later than the
 date specified on the travel confirmation, or if no date is specified, no later than 10 weeks 
 before your departure date. If we do not receive full payment by the due date, then we reserve the 
 right to treat your booking as cancelled by you and cancellation charges will be applicable.
Payment will be accepted by: Visa Debit, Visa Credit, MasterCard, and Master Debit Cards. Bank 
Deposit/Transfer (Details available from your consultant).

    </p1>
     
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h4>3.Cost of Air Fares (Other Arrangements)</h4>
    <p1>
    Airfares and their conditions can change without warning, and customers who have paid only a deposit
     amount should be aware, a deposit is only reserving the seat, NOT the price of the ticket. Airlines
      are at liberty to change prices at any time up to the date of travel and this can apply to issued 
      tickets, but in practice, airlines usually honour prices where tickets have been issued. For customers
       that have only paid a deposit for air tickets, Bliss Flights LTD will attempt to provide advance 
       warning of price increases in an effort to allow you to pay at the original price, but cannot guarantee
        to do so.
<br/>
Most discounted air tickets are Non-refundable, Non-changeable and Non-transferable, unless otherwise 
specified. Please check whether you need a changeable ticket.
<br/>
Passengers must check their booking confirmation documentation to ensure that all name spellings are correctly
 as per their passports and that the travel itinerary is correct. Changes may not be permissible once tickets 
 are issued, and a fee for a new ticket may be charged.
 <br/>

Please ensure that the dates and times of your flights are correct and the names of travellers with their
 date of birth are accurate as per the corresponding passport. Tickets are non-transferable and name changes are not permitted. In some cases, the airline may not allow any changes and may demand a full re-purchase of the product. <br/>

Passengers must be at the airport and available to check-in at least three hours prior to departure. Tickets cannot be refunded or changed due to passenger no show at the airport.
Passengers are responsible for ensuring they have all the correct travel documentation including visas. Visas may be required for the entire journey, both for the destination and/or transit. Visas must be secured before ticket issue. Ticket refunds cannot be made in the event of the passenger’s failure to obtain the correct visa. <br/>

We need your mobile number so that we may call or text you about any changes to your itinerary and to provide helpful information about your trip. <br/>

Total price shown includes all applicable taxes and fees. Some airlines may charge additional baggage fees or other fees. Fares are not guaranteed until ticketed.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    </p1>
    
    <h4>4.Airport Charges and Departure Taxes</h4>
    <p1>
    Action by UK or Overseas Governments and other Authorities including mandatory increases or new charges are not covered by the company’s price Guarantee. UK Air Passenger Duty, together with the Airport and Departure Taxes, will be charged separately to the fares as per invoice.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    </p1>
    <h4>5.Accuracy</h4>
    <p1>
    Whilst we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our work, please carefully check all passenger and flight itinerary details as soon as you receive them and immediately advise us of any discrepancies. The name shown on all travel documents should match those on your passport(s). If you are getting married, or changing your name, the name(s) on your passport should reflect those on your travel documents. Failure to comply with this could result in amendment charges being levied, or possible cancellation of your flights.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    </p1>

    <h4>6.Amendments</h4>
    <p1>
    Should you wish to make any changes to your arrangements after they have been confirmed, we will endeavour to assist but cannot guarantee we will be able to do so. Amendment fees also vary from supplier to supplier so you must consult with us to establish the cost dependant on the type of change you wish to make.<br/>
Where the number of persons travelling is changed, the price for the booking will be recalculated on the new number of persons where applicable.
In most cases, name changes are not permitted by the airlines and they will almost always levy 100% cancellation charges. .<br/>
If you wish to alter the dates of your existing arrangements prior to payment of your balance, each amendment will incur a charge of £35 per person. Amendment charges will be added to your invoice and are non-refundable. Any additional charges passed on to us by airlines or suppliers will also be added to your invoice. We will always do our utmost to meet new instructions, but will only do so after instruction is receive in writing. .<br/>
Please note that we cannot make any refunds for unused flight, car hire or hotel vouchers etc. irrespective of what you are told by the supplier. Ground arrangement vouchers are only valid for the specific services for which they are issued. Please carefully read any vouchers and documentation sent to you as they contain useful information

    <br/>
    <br/>
    </p1>
    <h4>7.Cancellation</h4>
    <p1>
    This is where you wish to cancel your entire holiday arrangements, or a component of your holiday. The person who made the booking must notify us of any cancellation requests in writing.
Prior to payment of balance - If your entire travel arrangement is cancelled, all moneys paid will be forfeit. If a component of your holiday is cancelled, a charge of £35 per person will be levied. Where additional moneys have been paid, relating to a specific component, these moneys will be forfeit.
After full payment is made, but before departure – Most airfares carry a 100% cancellation charge, but where a cancellation can be arranged, charges are 15% of the total cost, plus loss of deposit and any insurance premium paid. Any additional cancellation charges passed on to us by airlines or suppliers will be additional to this. .<br/>
Many of our airfares have special conditions attached to them, which usually incur cancellation charges as high as 100%. These will be applied in addition to the above charges.
On or after departure cancellation charges will consist of those applied by the airline or operator and those of Bliss Flights. These may amount to the loss of all money paid even where a particular element remains wholly or partially unused. .<br/>
Note: If the reason for cancellation is covered under the terms of an insurance policy, you may be able to reclaim these charges. You will be advised of the exact amount prior to the cancellation being finalised.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    </p1>
    <h4>8.Refund</h4>
    <p1>
    Unused or part used air tickets are returned to the airline for authorisation and calculation of any refund due. Any refund received back from the airline is then subject to loss of deposit and 15% cancellation charges, unless advised differently at the time of booking. Refunds can take anywhere between two and six weeks and in some extra-ordinary circumstances up to six months, depending on the nature of the booking, to be dealt with by both the airline and Bliss Flight Ltd. In most cases, Bliss Flights is not permitted to make any refund without reference to the airline. Some airlines may require proof of departure from the destination country or a residency certificate, before refunding part used tickets. .<br/>
Deposit payments are 100% non-refundable

    <br/>
    <br/>
    </p1>
    <h4>9.Force Majeure</h4>
    <p1>
    This means that you will not be entitled for a full refund and we will not pay you compensation if we need to cancel or change your travel arrangements in any way because of unusual or unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control. These can include, for example, war, riot, industrial dispute, terrorist activity and its consequences, natural or nuclear disaster (such as volcanic ash), fire, adverse weather conditions and unavoidable technical problems with transport. Normal cancellation charges will be applied.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    </p1>
    <h4>10.Reconfirmation of Flights / Check-in</h4>
    <p1>
    On arrival at any destination, or stopover point, it is imperative that you reconfirm the reservations, timings and check-in details of your flight with the airline concerned, at least 72 hours prior to departure. This also applies to your first flight from the UK. This action allows the airline to inform you of any unforeseen delays or changes to your itinerary and provides the airlines with a contact for you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    </p1>
    <h4>11.Routing and Timings</h4>
    <p1>
    Unless otherwise stated, the routing of your air ticket cannot be changed once the balance has been paid. Please note that the timings of air departures are estimates only. These timings may alter if affected by operational difficulties, weather conditions or passenger issues, such as failure to check in on time. Flight timings may be subject to change as a result of airline procedures, up to date times will appear on your final itinerary. Please also note carriers have conditions of carriage which will apply to you and which limit or exclude liability. Copies are available from the relevant airlines website. We do not make arrangements in the event of an airline delay disrupting any leg of the outbound or inbound points of your flight. Most airlines however, do make provision for such instances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    </p1>
    <h4>12. Special Requests</h4>
    <p1>
    In the event of making requests such as dietary requirements, seating, wheelchair etc. We will communicate your request direct to the airline. Bliss Flights cannot guarantee requests as these are the sole prerogative of the airline concerned, hence we cannot be held responsible for any refusal.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    </p1>
    <h4>13.Passport and Visa Requirements</h4>
    <p1>
    A valid ten-year passport is required for visits to all destinations. It is the customer’s responsibility to check the validity of your passport and any visa requirements with the appropriate consulates. Also, if appropriate, please check you have a full driving license and are eligible to drive in the country concerned. .<br/>
Passports must be valid for at least six months beyond the period of your stay.
ESTA visa is a mandatory requirement for all USA bound travel, including transiting the USA.
ETA visa is a mandatory requirement for all Australia bound travel, including transiting Australia.
ETA visa is a mandatory requirement for all Canada bound travel, including transiting Canada.
NZeTA is a mandatory requirement for all New Zealand bound travel, including transiting New Zealand. .<br/>
If your flight has a change involving two different airports within the itinerary, it is your responsibility to organize any airport transfer required, and also to check and secure any transit visa required.
If you have booked code-share flights, terminal change may apply and you may require transit visa for changing terminals. Please contact the embassy or airline direct to ascertain correct visa requirements in case of terminal change. .<br/>
Bliss Flights LTD is not responsible for any Visa formalities. Please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for this information. .<br/>
Passengers are responsible for ensuring they have all the correct travel documentation including visas. Visas may be required for the entire journey, both for the destination and/or transit. Visas must be secured before ticket issue. Ticket refunds cannot be made in the event of the passenger’s failure to obtain the correct visa. .<br/>

All travellers (including children and infants) will require a valid passport to travel. Different countries have their own entry requirements, from how much validity your passport requires, to whether or not you require a visa. It is important that you make sure you are aware of the entry requirements for not only the country you are visiting, but also any you may transit via.
If your passport is endorsed in any way, you should always check with the relevant embassy. Please note, getting or renewing passports can take a number of weeks, so please leave plenty of time prior to travel. Normal recommendation is that you have at least six months validity remaining on your passport on your return date, in fact this is now mandatory in a number of countries. .<br/>
It is your responsibility to ensure you have all necessary travel documents prior to travel. We cannot accept any liability if you are refused boarding or entry into a country due to incorrect documentation.
